Peer Review by Michael Dada and Joe Karasek
========================

1. You don't need to include all of the files that come with bootstrap, just the ones that are labeled with .min.css and .min.js.  The other files (.map and the ones without .min) are maps of the files and the uncompressed versions. If you are not linking to these, and you are not, then they are just bloating the size of your site.

2. No readme.md...

3. Your html looks great. Nice indenting, easy to follow.

4. Your js also looks great. Good choice of variable names.

5. This project was easy to follow, you may consider getting into the habit of commenting your code as you go, so bigger projects stay organized.

# Great Job!
